# 🎟 NGMC Smart Ticketing System

> A smart, web‑based ticketing system designed for **college internal use**, enabling staff to raise issues digitally and notify the respective lab in‑charge for quick resolution.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**NGMC Smart Ticketing System** is a college‑oriented web application developed as a **model system** to simplify issue reporting and resolution within laboratories.

Instead of calling or manually informing the lab in‑charge, staff members can **raise a ticket online** when they face any system or lab‑related issue. The raised ticket is sent directly to the **lab in‑charge**, who can view the issue and take necessary action.

After resolving the issue, the staff member can provide **feedback**, which will be sent to the lab in‑charge via **email**.

This project focuses on improving communication, transparency, and efficiency in college lab management.
